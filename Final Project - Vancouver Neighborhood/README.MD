## Background
Vancouver, a bustling west coast seaport in British Columbia, is among Canadaâ€™s densest, most ethnically diverse cities known for its art and scenery. With a population of over 2.5 million, there are more than 200 ethnic groups in the country, making up more than 16 per cent of the total population. South Asians account for a quarter of all visible minorities in Canada, or four per cent of the total population. The vast majority of South Asians in Greater Vancouver and in adjacent cities are Punjabi Sikhs, differing greatly from the diverse ethnic and religious composition of South Asians in Canada. In 2013 Alexandra Gill of The Globe and Mail wrote that in regards to area food critics the Indian restaurant scene was "a largely unknown dining landscape.

## Business problem
Seeing the popularity of Indian food in Vancouver, the objective of the project is to use Foursquare API and clustering to best determine a neighborhood in Vancouver suitable to open an Indian restaurant. This will help business owners in deciding a convenient and apt location to open up a restaurant.
